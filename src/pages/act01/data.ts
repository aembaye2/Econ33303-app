      question:
        "A family makes the decision between enjoying a composite good consumption (C) and having kids (K). Assume the price of having kids is Pk and that of C is $1 as it is a composite good. Draw the budget constraint of this family putting C on the vertical axis and K on the horizontal axis and label all axes and your sketches.",

      question:
        "Now draw an the initial optimal point of this family as e1 with appropriate budget constraint and indifference curve. Now assuming that kids are inferior goods/services, show the new optimal point as e2 if the income of the family increases.",

      qtype: "graphing-quest",
      question:
        "Again, starting from the initial optimal point of this family as e1, suppose the price of having kids becomes cheaper, other things equal. Show the shift in the budget constraint and the possible point of family's new optimal point e2. And show the substitution and income effects of this decrease in price of having kids still assuming that kids are inferior goods.",
